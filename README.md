# Invisible_Cloak

A fun Computer Vision project using Python & OpenCV to simulate Harry Potter’s Invisibility Cloak. Uses color detection (HSV) and background replacement to make the cloak wearer invisible in real-time.

How It Works:-

1) Capture the background frame
2) Detect the chosen cloak color using HSV values
3) Replace the cloak area with the saved background → now you are invisible

🛠️ Tech Stack

1) Python 3
2) OpenCV (cv2)
3) NumPy

Features:
✔️ Works in real-time with webcam
✔️ Adjustable HSV sliders for better color detection
✔️ Fun mix of Computer Vision + a little magic ✨
